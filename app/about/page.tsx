        <h1>About College Alumni Fantasy</h1>
        <p>
          College Alumni Fantasy tracks how every school would fare if it fielded a fantasy roster built entirely
          from its NFL alumni. We compile weekly scoring data, simulate matchups, and surface the stories that make
          alumni pride so much fun to follow.

        <p>
          To keep the project sustainable we occasionally share gear and book recommendations through Amazon affiliate
